# Budgeting App
This is a simple budgettng app, an SPA (Single Page Application) application. I decided to develop it for fun while learning Vue as a learning experience. Features include creating budgets for things like utilities, rent, etc., creating graphs enabling one to see where money was being spent at a glance.
